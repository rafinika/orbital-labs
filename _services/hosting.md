Everyone wants to go digital, but which way to go? And why is it important to have a digital transformation strategy? We can start from the basic one, a website. Living in the digital world, a website is crucial for any organization. If you have a business and donâ€™t have a website, you are probably losing out on opportunities for your business. A website is also important because it helps to establish credibility as a business. Every type of communication, piece of content, or advertisement that you put online will drive the consumer back to your website.
